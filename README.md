Project Description-The EduTutorAI project is an AI-powered personalized learning platform designed to transform the way students learn and interact with educational content. Built using advanced technologies like IBM Watsonx, Natural Language Processing (NLP), LangChain, and Streamlit, the system integrates generative AI to provide intelligent tutoring, real-time doubt solving, and adaptive learning recommendations.EduTutorAI automates multiple aspects of the learning process by analyzing student queries, generating contextual explanations, suggesting practice materials, and delivering subject-specific assistance. The platform allows users to input natural language questions, upload study materials (such as PDFs), and receive structured summaries, explanations, or even quiz-style practice questions generated on the fly.The solution features an AI-powered chatbot that serves as a virtual tutor, capable of answering questions across domains, providing explanations at different difficulty levels, and offering continuous learning support. On the backend, FastAPI ensures efficient API request handling, while the frontend, developed using Streamlit, provides a visually engaging, interactive, and user-friendly dashboard.EduTutorAI is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, with seamless integration between AI models, APIs, and user interactions. It includes a student progress tracking system, a recommendation engine for study resources, and multi-language support for accessibility. Deployment is streamlined using Uvicorn and Streamlit, with well-documented APIs available for extension and integration.
